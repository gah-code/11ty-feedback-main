Hello awesome person! Thank you so much for taking the time to stop by! 

Below you'll find three goals that I am currently working on. I would absolutely love if you could give me your honest thoughts on how I am doing with regard to these goals, including any criticism, praise, and / or advice you feel comfortable giving. 

On that note, I want you to feel as safe and comfortable as possible here! I am actively seeking out your feedback because I trust and respect you. In filling out this little form and clicking the submit button, you can be assured that I will:
- Not take offense upon receipt of negative feedback.
- Be appreciative of your time spent and feedback given.
- Seriously and thoughtfully consider your feedback.
- Develop a plan on how I can meaningfully act on it.
- Praise your act of giving feedback / mentorship to those you'd like to hear it (e.g. your manager, if you want).
- Give feedback to you (if you want / if I haven't already).
- Something else I'm missing?

Also, below the explanation of each goal you will find a short self-evaluation that details how I'm currently working towards the goal. Feel free to ignore or use it if it helps in your own feedback formulation.

Can't wait to read your thoughts!
